The first successful brew in over 3 years! It is pretty okay!

Got the PicoBrew Model S (now called the Pro, I guess) working.  Had to dig into the machine and replace the circulation pumps' diaphram.  Decided it was time to fire it up, so I used an old (1-ish year expired) brew kit I had around: "Whetstoner Session IPA".

Specifics:
Brewed 2019-11-26
Pitched Yeast: 2019-11-27
Fast Fermented @ 75*F (5psi)

Starting Gravity: 1.043 (10.8 brix)
Final Gravity: 1.021 (5.3 brix)
Calculated ABV: 4.8%

Siphoned off the trub, and then filled two 16oz flip-top bottles to condition for a few weeks.  Force carbonated the remaining (~50% batch) in the keg to be served at my work Christmas Party.

Need to drink the carbonated version to accurately taste, but flat thoughts were it was a relatively mild and balanced session.  Hazy as all heck.  Surprised there wasn't more clarity after cold crashing, but this may be an artifact inherent to the super-small batch (5L) size.
