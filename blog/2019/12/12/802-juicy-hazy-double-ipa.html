<h1>802 Juicy Hazy Double IPA</h1>

<p class="view">by </p>

<p>Beer #2!</p>

<p>This was a new kit that required the addition of 3/4 cup of Maple Syrup.  I used New Hampshire Grade A Robust.</p>

<p>Specifics:
Brewed 2019-11-29
Pitched Yeast: 2019-11-29
Fast Fermented @ 75*F (5psi)</p>

<p>Starting Gravity: 1.065 (15.9 brix)
Final Gravity: 1.027 (6.7 brix)
Calculated ABV: 8%</p>

<p>Siphoned off the trub, and then filled two 16oz flip-top bottles to condition for a few weeks.  Force carbonated the remaining (~50% batch) in the keg to be served at my work Christmas Party.</p>

<p>Flat beer thoughts: Whoa, that dry-hop nose.  Hops foreverrrrrr.   It does have a bit of a citrus-y juicy vibe, but not as strong as the kit name would imply.  Hazy as heck.</p>
